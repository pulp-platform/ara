### Fixed

## 0.6.0 - 2021-02-24

### Added

- Support for a coherent mode between Ara and Ariane
  - Snoop AW channel from Ara to L2
  - Invalidate Ariane's L1 cache sets accordingly
  - Coherent mode can be toggled together with consistent mode using the LSB of CSR 0x702

### Changed

- Ariane's data cache is active by default
- The matrix multiplication kernel achieves better performance
  - It reports the performance and the utilization for several matrix sizes

## 0.5.0 - 2021-02-14

### Added

- Hardware support for:
  - Vector single-width integer divide instructions (vdivu, vdiv, vremu, vrem)
  - Vector integer comparison instructions (vmseq, vmsne, vmsltu, vmslt, vmsleu, vmsle, vmsgtu, vmsgt)
  - Vector carry-out of add-with-carry and subtract-with-borrow instructions (vmadc, vmsbc)
- Runtime measurement functions
- Consistent mode which orders scalar and vector loads/stores.
  - Conservative ordering without address comparison
  - Consistent mode is enabled per default, can be disabled by clearing the LSB of CSR 0x702.

### Fixed

- Ariane's accelerator dispatcher module was rewritten, fixing a bug where instructions would get skipped.
- The Vector Store unit takes the EEW of the source vector register into account to shuffle the elements before writing them to memory.

### Changed

- Vector mask instructions (vmand, vmnand, vmandnot, vmxor, vmor, vmnor, vmornot, vmxnor) no longer require the non-compliant constraint that the vector length is divisible by eight.

## 0.4.0 - 2021-02-04

### Added

- Hardware compilation with Verilator
- Software implementation of a matrix multiplication kernel

### Changed

- The `riscv_tests_simc` Makefile target was deprecated. The riscv-tests are now run with the Verilated design, which can be called through the `riscv_tests_simv` Makefile target.
- The operand queues now take as a parameter the type conversions they support (currently, `SupportIntExt2`, `SupportIntExt4`, and `SupportIntExt8`)
- The Vector Multiplier unit now has independant pipelines for each element width.
